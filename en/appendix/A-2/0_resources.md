## 2.3. Resources

##### There are many resources available to learn more about Grasshopper and parametric design concepts. There are also over a hundred plugins and add-ons that extend Grasshopper’s functionality. Below are some of our favorites.

![IMAGE](images/python.png)
GhPython is the Python interpreter component for Grasshopper that allows you to execute dynamic scripts of any type. Unlike other scripting components, GhPython allows the use of rhinoscriptsyntax to start scripting without needing to be a programmer.

![IMAGE](images/meshedit.png)
Meshedit is a set of components which extend Grasshopper’s ability to work with meshes.
http://www.food4rhino.com/project/meshedittools

![IMAGE](images/parametric-tools.png)
Parametric tools to create and manipulate rectangular grids, attractors and support creative morphing of parametric patterns.
http://www.food4rhino.com/project/pt-gh

![IMAGE](images/platypus.png)
Platypus allows Grasshopper authors to stream geometry to the web in real time. It works like a chatroom for parametric geometry, and allows for on-the-fly 3D model mashups in the web browser.
http://www.food4rhino.com/project/platypus

![IMAGE](images/tt-toolbox.png)
TT Toolbox features a range of different tools that we from the Core Studio at Thornton Tomasetti use on a regular basis, and we thought some of you might appreciate these.
http://www.food4rhino.com/project/tttoolbox

![IMAGE](images/weaverbird.png)
Weaverbird is a topological modeler that contains many of the known subdivision and transformation operators, readily usable by designers. This plug-in reconstructs the shape, subdivides any mesh, even made by polylines, and helps preparing for fabrication.

### Additional Primers
**The Firefly Primer**
This book is intended to teach the basics of electronics (using an Arduino) as well as various digital/physical prototyping techniques to people new to the field. It is not a comprehensive book on electronics (as there are already a number of great resources already dedicated to this topic). Instead, this book focuses on expediting the prototyping process. Written by Andrew Payne.

**Essential Mathematics**
Essential Mathematics uses Grasshopper to introduce design professionals to foundation mathematical concepts that are necessary for effective development of computational methods for 3D modeling and computer graphics. Written by Rajaa Issa.
http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5.0/EssentialMathematicsThirdEdition/

**Generative Algorithms**
A series of books which is aimed to develop different concepts in the field of Generative Algorithms and Parametric Design. Written by Zubin Khabazi.
http://www.morphogenesism.com/media.html

**Rhino Python Primer**
This primer is intended to teach programming to absolute beginners, people who have tinkered with programming a bit or expert programmers looking for a quick introduction to the methods in Rhino. Written by Skylar Tibbits.
http://www.rhino3d.com/download/IronPython/5.0/RhinoPython101

### General References
**Wolfram MathWorld** is an online mathematics resource., assembled by Eric W. Weisstein
with assistance from thousands of contributors. Since its contents first appeared online in 1995, MathWorld has emerged as a nexus of mathematical information in both the mathematics and educational communities. Its entries are extensively referenced in journals and books spanning all educational levels.
