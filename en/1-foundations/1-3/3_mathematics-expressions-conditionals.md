#####Knowing how to work with numeric information is an essential skill to master as you learn to use Grasshopper. Grasshopper contains many components to perform mathematical operations, evaluate conditions and manipulate sets of numbers.

In mathematics, numbers are organized by sets and there are two that you are probably familiar with:

Integer Numbers: […, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …]<br>
Real Numbers: [8, …, -4.8, -3.6, -2.4, -1.2, 0.0, 1.234, e, 3.0, 4.0, …, 8]

While there are other types of number sets, these two interest us the most
because Grasshopper uses these extensively. Although there are limitations in representing these sets exactly in a digital environment, we can approximate them to a high level of precision. In addition, it should be understood that the
distinction between Integral types (integers) and Floating types (real numbers) corresponds to the distinction between discrete and continuous domains. In
this chapter, we’re going to explore different methods for working with and
evaluating various sets of numbers.

####1.3.3.1. THE MATH TAB
Most of the components that deal with mathematical operations and functions can be found under the following sub-categories of the Math tab:

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_01-the-math-tab.png)

>1. Domains are used to define a range of values (formerly known as intervals) between two numbers. The components under the Domain tab allow you to create or decompose different domain types.
2. In mathematics, a matrix is an array of numbers organized in rows and columns. This subcategory contains a series of utility tools to construct and modify matrices.
3. Operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, etc. Conditional operators allow you to determine whether a set of numbers are larger than, less than, or similar to another set of numbers.
4. Polynomials are one of the most important concepts in algebra and throughout mathematics and science. You can use the components found in this subcategory to compute factorials, logarithms, or to raise a number to the nth power.
5. The script subcategory contains single and multi-variable expressions as well as the VB.NET and C# scripting components.
6. These components allow you to solve trigonometric functions such as Sine,Cosine, Tangent, etc.
7. The time subcategory has a number of components which allow you to construct instances of dates and times.
8. The utility subcategory is a ‘grab bag’ of useful components that can be used in various mathematical equations. Check here if you’re trying find the maximum or minimum values between two lists of numbers; or average a group of numbers.

####1.3.3.2. OPERATORS
As was previously mentioned, Operators are a set of components that use
algebraic functions with two numeric input values, which result in one output
value.

Most of the time, you will use the Math Operators to perform arithmetical
actions on a set of numbers. However, these operators can also be used on
various data types, including points and vectors.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_02-operators.png)

####1.3.3.3. CONDITIONAL OPERATORS
Almost every programming language has a method for evaluating conditional
statements. In most cases the programmer creates a piece of code to ask a
simple question of “what if.” What if the area of a floor outline exceeds the
programmatic requirements? Or, what if the curvature of my roof exceeds a
realistic amount? These are important questions that represent a higher level
of abstract thought. Computer programs have the ability to analyze “what if”
questions and take actions depending on the answer to that question. Let’s take
a look at a very simple conditional statement that a program might interpret:
If the object is a curve, delete it. The piece of code first looks at an object and
determines a single boolean value for whether or not it is a curve. There is
no middle ground. The boolean value is True if the object is a curve, or False
if the object is not a curve. The second part of the statement performs an
action dependent on the outcome of the conditional statement; in this case,
if the object is a curve then delete it. This conditional statement is called an
If statement. There are four conditional operators (found under the Math/
Operators subcategory) that evaluate a condition and return a boolean value.

The Equality component takes two lists and compares the first item of List A and
compares it to the first item of List B. If the two values are the same, then a True
boolean value is created; conversely if the two values are not equal, then a False
boolean value is created. The component cycles through the lists according to
the set data matching algorithm (default is set to Longest List). There are two
outputs for this component. The first returns a list of boolean values that shows
which of the values in the list were equal to one another. The second output
returns a list that shows which values were not equal to one another - or a list
that is inverted from the first output.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_03-equality.png)

The Similarity component evaluates two lists of data and tests for similarity
between two numbers. It is almost identical to the way the Equality component
compares the two lists, with one exception: it has a percentage input that defines
the ratio of list A that list B is allowed to deviate before inequality is assumed.
The Similarity component also has an output that determines the absolute value
distance between the two input lists.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_04-similarity.png)

The Larger Than component will take two lists of data and determine if the first
item of List A is greater than the first item of List B. The two outputs allow you to
determine if you would like to evaluate the two lists according to a greater than
(>) or greater than and equal to (>=) condition.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_05-larger-than.png)

The Smaller Than component performs the opposite action of the Larger Than
component. The Smaller Than component determines if list A is less than list B
and returns a list of boolean values. Similarly, the two outputs let you determine
if you would like to evaluate each list according to a less than (<) or less than and
equal to (<=) condition.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_06-smaller-than.png)

####1.3.3.4. TRIGONOMETRY COMPONENTS
{% if gitbook.generator == "pdf" or gitbook.generator == "mobi" or gitbook.generator == "epub" %}

{% endif %}

We have already shown that we can use an Expression (or Evaluate) component
to evaluate conditional statements as well as compute algebraic equations.
However, there other ways to calculate simple expressions using a few of the
built in Trigonometry functions. We can use these functions to define periodic
phenomena like sinusoidal wave forms such as ocean waves, sound waves, and
light waves.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_07-line-sine-helix-spiral.png)

>1. Line<br>
```y(t) = 0```
2. Sine Curve<br>
```y(t) = sin(t)```
3. Helix<br>
```x(t) = cos(t)```<br>
```y(t) = sin(t)```<br>
```z(t) = b(t)```
4. Spiral<br>
```x(t) = t*cos(t)```<br>
```y(t) = t*cos(t)```

In this example, we will use Grasshopper to construct various trigonometric
curves using trigonometry function components found in the Math tab:

td:nth-child(3)	{width: 15%}

The Expression component (and its brother the Evaluate component) are
very flexible tools; that is to say that they can be used for a variety of different
applications. We can use an Expression (or Evaluate component) to solve
mathematical algorithms and return numeric data as the output.

![](images/1-3-3/1-3-3_22-expression-evaluate.png)

In the following example, we will look at mathematical spirals found in nature
and how we can use a few Functions components to create similar patterns in
Grasshopper. We will build on our trigonometric curves definition as a starting
point.
