### 1.6.6 Working with Mesh Geometry

##### In this section, we will work through an exercise file for producing a complete mesh solid. By the end of this exercise, we will have a dynamic definition to produce custom vases that can be 3D printed.

>Example files that accompany this section: [http://grasshopperprimer.com/appendix/A-2/1_gh-files.html](http://grasshopperprimer.com/appendix/A-2/1_gh-files.html)
{% else %}
>Example files that accompany this section: [Download](../../appendix/A-2/gh-files/1.6.6_working with meshes.gh)
{% endif %}

Since this definition is somewhat longer than previous examples in this primer, we will first walk through the basic steps we will take:

![IMAGE](images/1-6-6/01_vase-steps.png)

>1. Create a series of circles as a base cylinder
2. Use a Graph Mapper component to define the profile of our vase
3. Construct the topology of the mesh faces to produce a single mesh surface
4. Cap the bottom of the mesh
5. Introduce a twist to the vertical orientation for a more dynamic form
6. Add corrugated ridges for a textured vase
7. Offset the mesh surface to give the vase thickness
8. Cap the top gap between the two surfaces to produce a closed solid

We now have a single surface for our vase. If we wanted to print this vase using a 3D printer, we need it to be a closed solid. We will create a solid by offsetting the current mesh, then combining the original mesh and the offset mesh.
