### 1.6.3 Creating  Meshes

##### In the last section, we looked at the basic structure of meshes. In this section, we give a brief introduction to different ways of generating mesh geometry.

There are three fundamental ways of creating mesh geometry in Grasshopper:
1. Starting with a mesh primitive
2. Manually constructing a mesh from faces and vertices
3. Converting NURBS geometry into a mesh

#### 1.6.3.1 Primitive

Grasshopper comes with a few simple mesh primitive components:

![IMAGE](images/1-6-3/01_primitives.png)
>1. **Mesh Box** - This primitve requires a Box object as an input which provides the size and location, as well as X,Y, and Z values that determine how many faces to divide the box into. The six sides of a Mesh Box are *unwelded* allowing for creases. (See the following section for more information about welded meshes)
2. **Mesh Plane** - This primitive requires a Rectangle input to determine the size and location of the plane, as well as W and H values to determine the number of faces.
3. **Mesh Sphere** - This primitive requires a base plane to determine the center and orientation of the sphere, a radius for the size, and U and V values to determine the number of faces.
4. **Mesh Sphere Ex** - Also known as a Quadball, this primitive creates a sphere composed of six patches, which are subdivided according to the C input. A quadball is topologically equivalent to a cube, even though it is geometrically spherical.

#### 1.6.3.2 Construct Mesh

![IMAGE](images/1-6-3/construct-mesh.png)

As we saw in the previous section, the **Construct Mesh** component can be used to directly create a mesh from a list of vertices and a list of faces (and an optional list of vertex colors). Constructing an entire mesh manually can be extremely tedious, so this component is more often used with an existing list of faces and vertices which have been extracted using a **Deconstruct Mesh** component on an existing mesh.

#### 1.6.3.3 NURBS to Mesh

Perhaps the most common method of creating a complex mesh is to generate one based off of NURBS geometry. Individual NURBS surfaces can be converted to a mesh using the **Mesh Surface** component, which simply subdivides the surface along its UV coordinates and creates quad faces. This component allows you to enter the number of U and V divisions for the resultant mesh.

More complex polysurfaces can be converted to a single mesh with the **Mesh Brep** component. This component also has an optional Settings input, which can be set by using one of the built in *Speed*, *Quality*, or *Custom* Settings components, or by right-clicking the S input and selecting "Set Mesh Options". For efficient use of meshes, it is often necessary to refine this mesh by using various strategies such as rebuilding, smoothing, or subdividing. Some of these techniques will be discussed later in this Primer.

>1. **Mesh Surface** converts a NURBS surface to a mesh
2. **Mesh Brep** can convert polysurfaces and more complicated geometry into a single mesh. Adjusting the settings will allow for more or less faces, and a finer or coarser mesh.

NOTE: it is generally much easier to convert from a NURBS geometry to a mesh object rather than the other way around. While the UV coordinates of a NURBS surface are straightforward to convert to quad faces of a mesh, the opposite is not necessarily true, since a mesh might contain a combination of triangles and quads in a way that is not simple to extract a UV coordinate system out of. 

#### 1.6.3.4 Exercise

In this exercise, we use a basic Mesh primitive, perform a transformation on the vertices, and then assign a color based on the normal vectors to approximate the rendering process.

>We deconstructed the mesh to get its vertices, faces, and normals. We then simply moved each vertex according to its normal vector. Because we did not change the topology of the sphere at all, we re-used the list of faces to re-construct the new mesh. Normal vectors always have a length of one, so this ended up reconstructing a new mesh sphere with a radius of one more than the original sphere. 

Next, we will use a sine function to manipulate the sphere in a slightly more complicated way.

>We used the Expression results to drive both the movement of the vertices and the color of the mesh, so the color gradient in this case corresponds to the magnitude of the movement of the vertices.

>We used the white-to-black preset for our gradient. This sets the mesh color according to the angle between the normal and the light source, with normals that are directly facing the light source to black and the normals facing away from the source to white (To be a little more accurate, you can reverse the gradient by adjusting the handles). The actual process of rendering a mesh is much more complicated than this, obviously, but this is the basic process of creating light and shadow on a rendered object.
